The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken
from Fisher's paper. Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI
Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

The data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same
region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different
measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of
wine.

Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
        worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
        resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
        10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Separating plane described above was obtained using
Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree
Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th
Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets",
Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

Heart Disease UCI dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
-------------------------

Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Content
    - Attribute Information:
        1. age
        2. sex
        3. chest pain type (4 values)
        4. resting blood pressure
        5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
        6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
        7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
        8. maximum heart rate achieved
        9. exercise induced angina
        10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
        11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
        12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
        13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. 
One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Bank Note Authentication UCI dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/ritesaluja/bank-note-authentication-uci-data)
------------------------------------
About this file
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. 
For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. 
The final images have 400x 400 pixels. 
Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. 
Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Pima Indians Diabetes Database (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
------------------------------
About this file
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. 
Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
